# Color Game!
Color Guessing Game built for Coding Bootcamp.

Still needs some styling and possibly some different options for the game - as of now it's very similar to the one used in the Bootcamp and I'd like to add my own personal styles to it when I get the chance. 

You are given an RGB color and must choose from either 3 (Easy Mode) colors to guess, or 6 (Hard Mode) colors to guess. When the square is clicked, if you are correct the whole screen will change to the correct color. If wrong, it will prompt you to try again. Enjoy!
